New design and a blog!

I had about three days of winter break left, and I was really bored. I spent the afternoon of the day before reading *Ready Player One* cover to cover, so I wasn't in the mood to spend another whole day on another book. Video games did not feel that productive. So I decided to completely redesign my website. I'm still not completely done, but I think I got most of the kinks out and it's completely usable on modern browsers.

### things i might want to do
* smartypants for fancy typography
* play with the syntax highlighter & formatting
* play around with the header font sizes
* tags and categories?
* print stylesheet
* make sure everything up to IE9 (maybe 8?) works right
* search box on blog archives & 404
* custom 404 page
* new cover image
* new background image

I was really surprised that it only took me a few days to build a whole new design from scratch in only a few days. I also moved from LESS to SCSS since I had to use Ruby and Jekyll for this new blog. At first I was reluctant to use Jekyll, mainly because I'd have to run `jekyll serve -w` every single time I wanted to start working on the site. But I was already compiling LESS files with an Atom plugin and using [HFS](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) to preview my site. Jekyll is arguably faster than running HFS every time and I get more features. My other option for the blog was the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) platform, but that runs on node.js, so I'd have to find a reliable free host, and adjusting my site layout for Ghost felt like a hassle, so I just ended up sticking with Github Pages.

### why a blog?
This domain name was free for a year courtesy of [namecheap education](https://nc.me/), but I'm going to be paying for it after that, so might as well get the most out of it. I also bought a .com prior to the free domain, so I'm going to have to find a way to use it. This will primarily be a programming blog, though occasionally other things might slip in if it warrants me doing a complete writeup on it. I also don't have a blog format in mind, so I expect to be making lots and lots of changes to the site in the future.

I wrote some sample code for my friend, who learned Python this quarter and wants to learn Java, so my first real post will probably be about Python and Java.

That's all for now. Peace out.
